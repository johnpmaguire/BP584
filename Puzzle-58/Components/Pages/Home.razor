<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="() => SetClient(Client.Generic)">Generic</button>
<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="() => SetClient(Client.Acme)">Acme</button>

<p>In this demo, we have created an architecture that lets us customize the experience for our different clients.</p>
<p>In the real world, the client would be decided based on the login or some other method.</p>
<p>We want to use an appstate component for each client, but we don't want to cascade it around the entire app.</p>
<p>Instead, we want to create a state component for each client, and be able to access it as a scoped parameter in all the pages in each client.</p>
<p>How can we provide customized state components for each client and maintain that state across client pages?</p>


@code{

    [CascadingParameter]
    public CascadingAppState AppState { get; set; }

    public void SetClient(Client client)
    {
        AppState.CurrentClient = client;
    }
}
